# Get the NDWI Satellite Images

The Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) is a valuable tool for monitoring and managing water resources using satellite imagery. This repository provides access to NDWI satellite images, which can be used for various applications such as detecting water bodies, assessing drought conditions, and managing irrigation systems.

## Example Usage

For a practical example of how to use NDWI satellite images, please refer to the following Kaggle notebook: [Using Sentinel Satellite Images](https://www.kaggle.com/code/sndorburian/using-sentinel-satellite-images/notebook). This notebook demonstrates the process of acquiring, processing, and analyzing NDWI images using Sentinel satellite data.

## Getting Started

To get started with NDWI satellite images, follow these steps:

1. **Acquire Satellite Data**: Obtain satellite images from sources such as Sentinel or Landsat.
2. **Preprocess the Data**: Perform necessary preprocessing steps such as atmospheric correction and cloud masking.
3. **Calculate NDWI**: Use the appropriate formula to calculate the NDWI from the satellite images.
4. **Analyze and Visualize**: Analyze the NDWI results and visualize them to gain insights into water resource management.
